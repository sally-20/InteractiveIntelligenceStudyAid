                <h2>Derivatives instruments available in India</h2>
                <p>
                    In this sub-lesson, we will explore the various types of derivatives instruments that are available in the Indian market. Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from an underlying asset, such as stocks, commodities, or currencies. These instruments are widely used by investors and traders to manage risk, speculate on price movements, and hedge their positions.<br>
                    <br>
                    1. Futures Contracts:<br>
                    Futures contracts are one of the most common types of derivatives instruments in India. These contracts obligate the buyer to purchase an underlying asset and the seller to sell the asset at a predetermined price and date in the future. Futures contracts are standardized and traded on exchanges, such as the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).<br>
                    <br>
                    2. Options Contracts:<br>
                    Options contracts give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset at a predetermined price and date in the future. Options provide flexibility to investors as they can choose whether or not to exercise the contract. Like futures contracts, options contracts are also traded on exchanges in India.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. Index Futures and Options:<br>
                    In addition to individual stocks, derivatives instruments are also available for trading on stock market indices, such as the Nifty 50 and the Sensex. Index futures and options allow investors to speculate on the overall movement of the market without having to trade individual stocks.<br>
                    <br>
                    4. Currency Derivatives:<br>
                    Currency derivatives are contracts that allow investors to speculate on the exchange rate between two currencies. These derivatives instruments are useful for individuals and businesses who have exposure to foreign currencies and want to hedge against currency fluctuations. Currency futures and options are traded on exchanges in India.<br>
                    <br>
                    5. Commodity Derivatives:<br>
                    Commodity derivatives are contracts that derive their value from commodities, such as gold, silver, crude oil, or agricultural products. These derivatives instruments are popular among traders and investors who want to gain exposure to the commodity markets without physically owning the underlying assets. Commodity futures and options are traded on exchanges in India.

                <h2>Understanding futures and options in the Indian context</h2>
                <p>
                    In this sub-lesson, we will explore the concepts of futures and options in the Indian context. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from an underlying asset. Futures and options are two types of derivatives commonly traded in the Indian market.<br>
                    <br>
                    Futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a future date. These contracts are standardized and traded on exchanges. They are used by market participants to hedge against price fluctuations or speculate on the future price movement of the underlying asset.<br>
                    <br>
                    Options contracts, on the other hand, give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price within a specified period. There are two types of options: call options and put options. A call option gives the holder the right to buy the asset, while a put option gives the holder the right to sell the asset.<br>
                    <br>
                    In the Indian context, futures and options are widely used by investors and traders for various purposes. They provide opportunities for hedging against price risks, leveraging investments, and generating profits through speculation. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) are the major exchanges where futures and options are traded in India.

                <p>
                    In this sub-lesson, we will explore the regulations and trading platforms for derivatives in India. Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from an underlying asset. They are widely used for hedging, speculation, and arbitrage purposes. In India, derivatives trading is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which is the regulatory authority for the securities market.<br>
                    <br>
                    1. Regulatory Framework:<br>
                    SEBI has established a comprehensive regulatory framework for derivatives trading in India. The key regulations include:<br>
                    - SEBI (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2012: These regulations govern the functioning of stock exchanges and clearing corporations involved in derivatives trading.<br>
                    - SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015: These regulations prohibit insider trading in derivatives and other securities.<br>
                    - SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015: These regulations prescribe the listing obligations and disclosure requirements for companies whose securities are traded in derivatives.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. Trading Platforms:<br>
                    In India, derivatives trading takes place on two major stock exchanges: the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). These exchanges provide electronic trading platforms where investors can buy and sell derivatives contracts. The trading platforms offer various features and functionalities to facilitate efficient trading, including real-time market data, order matching systems, and risk management mechanisms.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. Types of Derivatives:<br>
                    The derivatives market in India offers various types of derivatives contracts, including:<br>
                    - Futures: These are standardized contracts that obligate the buyer to purchase an underlying asset and the seller to sell the asset at a predetermined price and date in the future.<br>
                    - Options: These contracts give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset at a predetermined price and date in the future.<br>
                    - Index derivatives: These derivatives are based on stock market indices, such as the Nifty 50 or the Sensex. They allow investors to gain exposure to the overall market movement.<br>
                    <br>
                    4. Market Participants:<br>
                    The derivatives market in India attracts various types of participants, including individual investors, institutional investors, and market makers. Individual investors can trade derivatives through brokerage firms, while institutional investors, such as mutual funds and insurance companies, participate in derivatives trading to manage their investment portfolios. Market makers are entities that provide liquidity by quoting bid and ask prices for derivatives contracts.<br>
                    <br>
                    5. Risk Management:<br>
                    Derivatives trading involves certain risks, including market risk, credit risk, and operational risk. To mitigate these risks, stock exchanges and clearing corporations in India have implemented robust risk management mechanisms. These mechanisms include margin requirements, position limits, and surveillance systems to monitor trading activities and detect any potential market manipulation or misconduct.
