            <h1>Types of mutual funds (equity, debt, hybrid)</h1>
            <div id="sublesson1">
                <h2>Understanding Indian equity mutual funds</h2>
                <p>
                    In this lesson, we will explore the different types of mutual funds, with a focus on Indian equity mutual funds. Mutual funds are financial instruments that pool money from investors and invest it in a basket of market-linked securities like stocks and bonds. They provide investors with professional exposure to these securities, even if they are not comfortable directly buying stocks or bonds.<br>
                    <br>
                    There are three main types of mutual funds: equity funds, debt funds, and hybrid funds.<br>
                    <br>
                    1. Equity Funds:<br>
                        - Equity funds invest primarily in stocks or equity shares of companies.<br>
                        - The Net Asset Value (NAV) of equity funds fluctuates with market price movements.<br>
                        - Equity funds are suited for individuals with a higher risk appetite, as they do not guarantee returns.<br>
                        - However, if chosen properly, these funds have a high potential for returns.<br>
                        - Capital appreciation can be expected over a 7 to 10-year period.<br>
                        - The performance of equity funds can be volatile, and it varies depending on the fund manager's performance.<br>
                        <br>
                    2. Debt Funds:<br>
                        - Debt funds invest primarily in fixed-income securities like bonds, government securities, and corporate debentures.<br>
                        - The NAV of debt funds is relatively stable compared to equity funds.<br>
                        - Debt funds are suited for individuals with a lower risk appetite, as they provide regular income and preservation of capital.<br>
                        - These funds have a conservative and long-term orientation.<br>
                        - Debt funds are often used in retirement plans and children's plans.<br>
                        <br>
                    3. Hybrid Funds:<br>
                        - Hybrid funds, also known as balanced funds, invest in a mix of equity and debt securities.<br>
                        - The proportion of equity and debt in a hybrid fund is pre-defined.<br>
                        - The objective of hybrid funds is to achieve moderate capital appreciation, preservation of capital, and some regular income.<br>
                        - Hybrid funds are suitable for individuals who want a balanced approach to investing.

                <h2>Exploring debt mutual funds in India</h2>
                <p>
                    In this lesson, we will explore debt mutual funds in India. Debt mutual funds are a type of mutual fund that primarily invests in fixed income securities such as government bonds, corporate bonds, and money market instruments. These funds are considered to be less risky compared to equity mutual funds, as they provide a fixed income and are not subject to the volatility of the stock market.<br>
                    <br>
                    Debt mutual funds in India can be further classified into different categories based on the duration of the underlying securities and the credit quality of the issuers. Let's take a look at some of the common types of debt mutual funds:<br>
                    <br>
                    1. Liquid Funds:<br>
                    Liquid funds are low-risk debt mutual funds that invest in very short-term fixed income securities with a maturity period of up to 91 days. These funds are suitable for investors who want to park their surplus funds for a short period of time and earn a higher return compared to traditional savings accounts.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. Income Funds:<br>
                    Income funds primarily invest in fixed income securities with a longer maturity period, ranging from 1 to 5 years. These funds aim to generate regular income for investors through interest payments and capital appreciation. Income funds are suitable for investors who have a moderate risk appetite and are looking for a steady income stream.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. Gilt Funds:<br>
                    Gilt funds invest in government securities issued by the central and state governments. These funds are considered to be the safest among debt mutual funds, as they carry no credit risk. Gilt funds are suitable for conservative investors who prioritize capital preservation over higher returns.<br>
                    <br>
                    4. Credit Opportunities Funds:<br>
                    Credit opportunities funds invest in fixed income securities issued by companies with lower credit ratings. These funds aim to generate higher returns by taking on credit risk. Credit opportunities funds are suitable for investors who are willing to take on higher risk in exchange for potentially higher returns.<br>
                    <br>
                    5. Dynamic Bond Funds:<br>
                    Dynamic bond funds have the flexibility to invest in debt securities across different maturities and credit ratings. The fund manager actively manages the portfolio based on interest rate and credit outlook. Dynamic bond funds are suitable for investors who want to take advantage of changing market conditions and potentially earn higher returns.

                <h2>Hybrid funds and their characteristics in the Indian Market</h2>
                <p>
                    In this sub-lesson, we will explore hybrid funds and their characteristics in the Indian market. Hybrid funds, also known as balanced funds, are a type of mutual fund that invests in a mix of both equity and debt instruments. These funds aim to provide investors with a balanced portfolio that offers both capital appreciation and regular income.<br>
                    <br>
                    Characteristics of Hybrid Funds:<br>
                    1. Asset Allocation: Hybrid funds maintain a pre-defined proportion of their portfolio in equity and debt instruments. The allocation can vary depending on the fund's investment objective and risk profile. The equity portion provides the potential for capital appreciation, while the debt portion offers stability and regular income.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. Moderate Risk: Hybrid funds are considered to have a moderate risk profile compared to pure equity funds. The presence of debt instruments helps to reduce the overall volatility of the fund. However, the risk level can vary depending on the allocation between equity and debt.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. Capital Appreciation and Regular Income: Hybrid funds aim to provide both capital appreciation and regular income to investors. The equity portion of the fund can generate capital gains over the long term, while the debt portion generates income through interest payments.<br>
                    <br>
                    4. Long-Term Orientation: Hybrid funds are typically suitable for investors with a long-term investment horizon. These funds are designed to deliver returns over a longer period, usually 3-5 years or more. Investors should have a patient approach and be willing to stay invested for the recommended time frame.<br>
                    <br>
                    5. Conservative Approach: Hybrid funds follow a conservative investment approach by investing in a mix of equity and debt instruments. This strategy aims to balance the risk and return potential of the fund. The debt portion provides stability, while the equity portion offers growth potential.<br>
                    <br>
                    6. Suitable for Retirement and Children's Plans: Hybrid funds are often recommended for retirement and children's plans due to their conservative nature and long-term orientation. These funds can help investors achieve their financial goals by providing a balanced approach to wealth creation and preservation.<br>
                    <br>
                    Now that we have learned about hybrid funds and their characteristics, let's test our understanding with some multiple-choice questions.
