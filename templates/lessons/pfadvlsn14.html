            <div id="sublesson1">
                <h2>Drafting and formalities of a will in India</h2>
                <p>
                    In this sub-lesson, we will learn about the drafting and formalities of a will in India. Creating a will is an important step in estate planning, as it ensures that your wealth is distributed according to your wishes after your demise. Let's understand the key concepts and requirements for drafting a legally valid will in India.<br>
                    <br>
                    1. Personal Information:<br>
                    A will should start with your personal information, including your name, date of birth, and address. This helps in identifying the testator (the person making the will) and ensures clarity.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. Declaration of Sound Mind:<br>
                    It is important to include a declaration stating that you are of sound mind and making the will without any pressure or influence. This declaration helps in establishing the validity of the will.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. Details of Property and Investments:<br>
                    The will should contain a comprehensive list of your assets, including insurance policies, bank accounts, real estate, mutual funds, shares, and any other investments. This ensures that all your assets are accounted for and can be distributed as per your wishes.<br>
                    <br>
                    4. Proportionate Distribution:<br>
                    Specify the proportion in which you want your assets to be divided among the beneficiaries. Clearly mention the parties to whom the assets should be distributed and the percentage or share they should receive. This helps in avoiding any confusion or disputes later on.<br>
                    <br>
                    5. Signature and Witnesses:<br>
                    The will should be signed by the person making the will (testator) on each page. Additionally, two witnesses should also sign the will. The witnesses should be younger than the testator and highly trusted individuals. Their signatures validate the authenticity of the will.<br>
                    <br>
                    6. Dated Will:<br>
                    Always ensure that the will is dated. This helps in establishing the timeline of the will and ensures that the latest will is considered as the final will.<br>
                    <br>
                    7. Ancestral Property:<br>
                    It is important to note that ancestral property cannot be passed on through a will. Only self-acquired and earned assets can be distributed through a will.

                <h2>Choosing an executor and witnesses in India</h2>
                <p>
                    In this sub-lesson, we will discuss the importance of choosing an executor and witnesses when creating a legally valid will in India.<br>
                    <br>
                    1. Executor:<br>
                    An executor is a person who is responsible for carrying out the instructions mentioned in the will after the death of the testator (the person who creates the will). It is important to choose a trustworthy and responsible individual as an executor. The executor should be someone who is willing to take on this responsibility and has the ability to handle legal and financial matters. It is advisable to discuss your decision with the chosen executor beforehand to ensure their willingness to fulfill this role.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. Witnesses:<br>
                    In India, a will must be signed by two witnesses in order to be considered legally valid. The witnesses should be adults who are not beneficiaries of the will. It is important to choose witnesses who are trustworthy and reliable. Ideally, the witnesses should be younger than the testator and should be highly trusted individuals. Their role is to confirm that the testator is of sound mind and is creating the will without any pressure or coercion.<br>
                    <br>
                    It is recommended to choose witnesses who are not related to the testator or the beneficiaries mentioned in the will. This helps to avoid any potential conflicts of interest or challenges to the authenticity of the will.<br>
                    <br>
                    Choosing an executor and witnesses is a crucial step in creating a legally valid will. It ensures that your wishes are carried out as per your instructions and provides legal validity to the document.

                <h2>Reviewing and updating a will under Indian law</h2>
                <p>
                    In this sub-lesson, we will discuss the importance of reviewing and updating a will under Indian law. It is crucial to regularly review and update your will to ensure that it reflects your current wishes and circumstances. Let's dive into the details.<br>
                    <br>
                    1. Why is it important to review and update a will?<br>
                    - A will is a legal document that outlines how your assets should be distributed after your death. However, life is dynamic, and your circumstances may change over time. By reviewing and updating your will, you can ensure that it accurately reflects your current wishes and takes into account any changes in your family, financial situation, or assets.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. When should you review your will?<br>
                    - It is recommended to review your will at least once every few years or whenever a significant life event occurs. Some common life events that may warrant a review of your will include marriage, divorce, birth or adoption of a child, death of a beneficiary, acquisition or sale of significant assets, or a change in your financial situation.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. What should you consider when reviewing your will?<br>
                    - When reviewing your will, consider the following factors:<br>
                        - Are all the beneficiaries and legal heirs mentioned in your will still relevant?<br>
                        - Have there been any changes in your assets or financial situation that need to be reflected in the will?<br>
                        - Are there any new assets or investments that should be included in the will?<br>
                        - Do you need to appoint a new executor or trustee?<br>
                        - Are there any changes in the laws or regulations that may affect the validity or distribution of your will?<br>
                        <br>
                    4. How to update a will?<br>
                    - To update your will, you have two options:<br>
                        - Create a new will: You can create a completely new will that supersedes the previous one. In this case, it is important to clearly state that the new will revokes all previous wills.<br>
                        - Create a codicil: A codicil is a legal document that amends or adds to an existing will. It is used when you want to make minor changes to your will without creating an entirely new document. A codicil must be signed and witnessed in the same way as a will.<br>
                        <br>
                    5. What are the legal requirements for updating a will?<br>
                    - When updating a will, it is important to follow these legal requirements:<br>
                        - The updated will or codicil should be in writing.<br>
                        - It should be signed by the testator (the person making the will) and witnessed by at least two witnesses.<br>
                        - The witnesses should not be beneficiaries or legal heirs mentioned in the will.<br>
                        - The witnesses should sign the will or codicil in the presence of the testator.
