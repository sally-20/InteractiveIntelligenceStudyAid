            <div id="sublesson1">
                <h2>Reporting rental income and expenses to Indian tax authorities</h2>
                <p>
                    In this sub-lesson, we will discuss the tax implications of rental income and how to report rental income and expenses to Indian tax authorities. It is important to understand the reporting requirements to ensure compliance with tax laws and avoid any penalties.<br>
                    <br>
                    1. Reporting Rental Income:<br>
                    When you earn rental income from your property, it is considered taxable income and must be reported to the Indian tax authorities. Rental income includes the rent you receive from tenants, as well as any additional income such as parking charges, late payment fees, or interest on security deposits.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. Expenses Deductible from Rental Income:<br>
                    You can deduct certain expenses from your rental income to reduce your taxable income. These expenses include advertising costs, travel expenses related to managing your rental property, cleaning and maintenance expenses, commissions paid to rental agencies, and repairs. It is important to keep proper records and receipts of these expenses for documentation purposes.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. Schedule E:<br>
                    To report your rental income and expenses, you will need to fill out Schedule E, which is a form specifically designed for rental property reporting. On Schedule E, you will need to provide details about each rental property, including the type of property, address, and your percentage of ownership if less than 100%.<br>
                    <br>
                    4. Reporting Multiple Rental Properties:<br>
                    If you own multiple rental properties, you will need to complete separate Schedule E forms for each property. However, you only need to fill in the Totals column on one Schedule E, which should include the combined totals of all your rental properties.<br>
                    <br>
                    5. Part Interest in a Rental Property:<br>
                    If you own only a part interest in a rental property, you should report only your share of the property's income and expenses on your Schedule E.

                <h2>Deducting eligible rental property expenses in India</h2>
                <p>
                    In this sub-lesson, we will discuss the tax implications of rental income in India and how to deduct eligible rental property expenses. <br>
                    <br>
                    When you earn rental income from a property in India, you are required to pay taxes on that income. However, you can also deduct certain expenses related to the rental property, which can help reduce your taxable income. Let's look at some eligible rental property expenses that you can deduct:<br>
                    <br>
                    1. Repairs and Maintenance: Any expenses incurred for repairs and maintenance of the rental property can be deducted. This includes expenses for fixing plumbing, electrical work, painting, etc. However, it's important to note that expenses for improvements or renovations are not deductible.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. Property Taxes: The property tax paid on the rental property can be deducted from your rental income. Make sure to keep a record of the property tax payments as proof.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. Insurance Premiums: If you have taken insurance for the rental property, the premiums paid can be deducted. This includes fire insurance, liability insurance, etc.<br>
                    <br>
                    4. Interest on Home Loan: If you have taken a home loan to purchase the rental property, you can deduct the interest paid on the loan. However, the principal repayment cannot be deducted.<br>
                    <br>
                    5. Professional Fees: Any fees paid to professionals such as lawyers, accountants, or property managers for managing the rental property can be deducted.<br>
                    <br>
                    It's important to maintain proper records and receipts for all these expenses to support your deductions. Also, remember that these deductions can only be claimed against the rental income and not against any other income you may have.

                <h2>Capital gains tax on property sales in India</h2>
                <p>
                    In this lesson, we will discuss the tax implications of rental income, specifically focusing on capital gains tax on property sales in India. <br>
                    <br>
                    Capital gains tax is a tax imposed on the profit realized from the sale of an investment property. In India, capital gains are classified as short-term and long-term.<br>
                    <br>
                    Short-term capital gains tax applies to properties held for 24 months or less. The gains are taxed at the individual's applicable income tax rate.<br>
                    <br>
                    Long-term capital gains tax applies to properties held for more than 24 months. The gains are taxed at a flat rate of 20%.<br>
                    <br>
                    To calculate the capital gains tax, you need to determine the cost of acquisition and the cost of improvement. The cost of acquisition includes the purchase price, stamp duty, and registration charges. The cost of improvement includes any expenses incurred to improve the property.<br>
                    <br>
                    To calculate the taxable capital gains, subtract the indexed cost of acquisition and the indexed cost of improvement from the selling price. The indexed cost takes into account the inflation during the holding period.<br>
                    <br>
                    Once you have the taxable capital gains, apply the applicable tax rate to calculate the capital gains tax liability.<br>
                    <br>
                    Now, let's move on to the questions.
