                <h2>Explanation of compound interest</h2>
                <p>
                    In this lesson, we will be discussing the concept of compound interest. Compound interest is a powerful tool that can help you grow your wealth over time. It is the interest that you earn on both your initial investment and any interest that has already been earned.<br>
                    <br>
                    Let's start with a simple example. Imagine you have $1,000 and you invest it at an annual interest rate of 10%. After the first year, you would earn $100 in interest, bringing your total to $1,100. Now, in the second year, you would earn interest not only on your initial $1,000 but also on the additional $100 that you earned in the first year. This means that you would earn $110 in interest, bringing your total to $1,210. As you can see, the interest you earn keeps growing each year because it is being applied to a larger amount of money.<br>
                    <br>
                    Compound interest works like a snowball effect. The more time you give it, the bigger it gets. This is why it is important to start investing early and let your money grow over a long period of time. Over time, compound interest can turn a small investment into a significant amount of money.

                <h2>How compound interest affects savings and investments</h2>
                <p>
                    In this sub-lesson, we will be discussing how compound interest affects savings and investments. Compound interest is a powerful concept that can greatly impact your financial growth over time. Let's dive into the details.<br>
                    <br>
                    Compound interest is the interest that is earned not only on the initial amount of money invested or saved but also on the accumulated interest from previous periods. This means that as time goes on, the interest you earn starts to compound and grow exponentially.<br>
                    <br>
                    To understand how compound interest works, let's consider an example. Suppose you have $1,000 and you invest it at an annual interest rate of 10%. After the first year, you would earn $100 in interest, making your total investment $1,100. In the second year, you would earn 10% interest on $1,100, which is $110. So, your total investment would become $1,210. As you can see, the interest you earn in the second year is not just based on the initial $1,000 but also on the interest earned in the first year. This compounding effect continues to grow over time.<br>
                    <br>
                    The power of compound interest becomes even more evident when you consider long-term investments. Let's say you invest $1,000 at a 10% interest rate and leave it untouched for 40 years. At the end of those 40 years, your initial investment would have grown to more than $45,000! This is because the interest keeps compounding year after year, allowing your money to grow exponentially.<br>
                    <br>
                    Compound interest can also be applied to savings accounts. When you save money in an account that earns compound interest, your savings will grow faster compared to a simple interest account. This is why it's important to take advantage of compound interest when saving for long-term goals like retirement.

                    In this lesson, we will be discussing compound interest and how it can help you grow your wealth over time. Compound interest is a powerful concept that can make your money work for you. Let's dive in!<br>
                    <br>
                    Compound interest is the interest that you earn on both the initial amount of money you invest or save, as well as the interest that accumulates over time. It's like a snowball effect, where your money grows exponentially.<br>
                    <br>
                    To understand compound interest, let's look at an example. Let's say you have $1,000 and you invest it at an annual interest rate of 10%. After the first year, you would earn $100 in interest, making your total investment $1,100. But here's where compound interest comes into play. In the second year, you would earn 10% interest on the new total of $1,100, which is $110. So now, your total investment would be $1,210. This process continues, with your money earning interest on top of interest, and your investment grows even faster.<br>
                    <br>
                    Now, let's see how compound interest can make a significant impact over a longer period of time. If you were to invest that initial $1,000 for 40 years at a 10% interest rate, your investment would grow to over $45,000! That's the power of compound interest.<br>
                    <br>
                    Compound interest is a key component of long-term investing. By starting early and allowing your money to grow over time, you can take advantage of the exponential growth that compound interest offers.<br>
                    <br>
                    Now that you understand the concept of compound interest, let's test your knowledge with some multiple-choice questions.
